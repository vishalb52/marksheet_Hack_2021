# marksheet_Hack_2021

## PROJECT TITLE
marksheet

## Developers- Vishal Kumar,Ashwin Prakash, Arpita Muleva, Sarthak Gupta (SRM IST)

## THEME
E-education

## DESCRIPTION
After each exam we yearn to get a better analysis of our performance so that we can try to improve it and then improve our results accordingly.
Our app is designed for students giving tests in preparation for competitive examinations so that they can better visualise and then analyse
their performance in a test. We help them in understanding their weak areas, what they need to improve and by how much margin. This helps them
in improving their performance and taking it to the next level. Our algorithms also allow the student to identify which chapters to focus on 
as a priority.

## USED
1- Jupyter Notebook(Python3)
2- Plotly package(Graphs)
3- Excel Sheets(Data)
4- Websites(HTML5, CSS3, Jquery, Javascript, Bootstrap, PHP)
5- Chatbot(Drift by MobileMonkey)

## FUTURE GOALS
-If we have more number of users, we will incorporate the data in a database using MongoDB.
-We will be able to provide rank analysis based on the percentile of the student using different algorithms. 
-If the number of chapters/test increases, we can use KNN(K-Nearest Neighbour) to predict the residue values.
-We aim to get in contact with schools and other educational facilities for students to help them provide a better performance analysis using
 our software(AWS servers will be used for running Jupyter Notebook files on cloud).
-We aim to provide a mobile application as well, through Flask, to provide mobility in our services.
